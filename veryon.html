since its launch in 2005, the bugatti veyron has been regarded as a                                     Bugatti set the benchmark even higher with the plan of turning the supercar into a 
supercar of superlative quality. it was a real challenge for luxury                                     road car suitable for everyday use. The development of the Veyron was one 
developers to fulfil the specifications that the new supercar was                                       of the greatest technological challenges ever known in the automotive industry.

and the ability to accelerate from 0 to 100 in under three seconds. even                            Barely any parts, components or systems could be taken from existing car 
experts thought it was impossible to achieve these performance specs                        concepts and used in the Veyron. Everything had to be developed from scratch in

The Chiron can accelerate from 0–97 km/h (0–60 mph) in 2.5 
seconds according to the manufacturer,0–200 km/h (0–124 mph) 
in 6.5 seconds and 0–300 km/h (0–186 mph) in 13.6 seconds. 
In a world-record-setting test at the time in 2017, the Chiron 
reached 400 km/h (249 mph) in 32.6 seconds, after which it
needed 9.4 seconds to brake to standstill.
